- Liebman, “Legal Reform: China’s Law Stability Paradox,” 2014

**the four parts** of Zhang’s “judicial syndrome”: 不专业、不独立、地方保护盛行、腐败猖獗 (pg. 18).

Liebman: Courts in recent years have welcomed greater oversight by people’s congresses, have increased roles for laypeople in hearing cases, and have emphasized public opinion in court decisions - also efforts to put opinions online and to make courts more accessible to litigants in rural areas.

“five years of retrogression” (bottom of p.26 **从09年到13年**) =  “turn against law” under Wang Shengjun/王胜俊 in Minzner.

**highlights** of the fourth five-year plan (2014-18): 司法独立、法官负责、公开，上海作为试点

Manifestations of China's “turn against law” according to Minzner: 从职业化转向大众化、从审判转向调解、法律无情叙事、强调以法庭维稳、打压维权律师、倡导党高于法、命地方官员压住地方纠纷

Liebman: China’s “law-stability paradox” -- Having devoted impressive resources to constructing a legal system in the 1980s and 1990s, the Chinese party state retreated from using the system in the face of new social problems in the 2000s. (context: late 90s punctuated by widespread protest and petitioning上访 ”black jail“; early 2000s policy emphasis on 建设和谐社会; coincided with the turn against law toward populist legality)

“emphasis on compensation and negotiated outcomes in criminal cases” (Liebman, 99) 

Liebman: the “three supremes” (p.101) - the supremacy of the party’s business, the supremacy of popular interests, and the supremacy of the constitution and law
