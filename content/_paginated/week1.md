## Week 1

- Moustafa, “Law and Courts in Authoritarian Regimes,” 2014
- Solomon, “Law and Courts in Authoritarian States,” 2015

the **essence** of authoritarianism in its various forms (including competitive authoritarianism and so-called hybrid regimes) lies in the concentration of political power in the hands of an autocrat or an oligarch.

**defining characteristic** of “rule of law” (ROL) vs. with “rule by law,” i.e. the exercise of political control through law 

Solomon: the law as an institutionalized constraint on the power of rulers/political authority as well as an instrument/tool of rule

**key functions** of law in authoritarian political contexts 

Moustafa: 
(a) exercise state power vis-a-vis opposition, (sidelining political opponents
(b) advance administrative discipline within state institutions, (principal-agent or center-local control
(c) maintain cohesion among various factions within the ruling coalition, 
(d) facilitate market transitions,
(e) contain majoritarian institutions through authoritarian enclaves, 
(f) delegate controversial reforms, and 
(g) bolster regime legitimacy (i.e., law as ideology)

Solomon: 
(a) an instrument of rule
(b) the cultivation of legitimacy for the regime
(c) the promotion of administrative accountability
(d) the promotion of trade and foreign investment

**four models of courts** in authoritarian political contexts/variation in the relationship between courts and political leaders (Solomon):

1 the disempowered court that is in the ruler’s control (minimally deals with private matters and hardly anything else)—rule by a political party and/or with a discrete ideology

**2** the fragmented court that is independent and protected but powerless—personal dictatorship

3 the contested court whose relative independence and politically meaningful jurisdiction can allow rulings against regime interests—older, stable regimes where there is some (liberalizing) group pushing for reform

**4** the formally independent and empowered court that is nevertheless aligned with regime interests—21st and up-to-date (informal bureaucratic rules thro performance evaluation systems and hard targets

China - a blend of a fragmented legal system and one governed by informal practices
