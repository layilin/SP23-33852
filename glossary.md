# Glossary  

This glossary contains definitions of key historical individuals, places, and plants mentioned in *The Sugar-Cane*. We include much of the same information in our footnotes to the poem, but it may be useful for the reader to see Grainger's reference points grouped together in this way. Grainger did mention a wide range of peoples, places, and plants, and he also mentioned many mythological or fictional characters and locations. We did not include the latter our lists, although it would be an interesting project to compare mythological and fictional references to historical ones.

British slave ships often made port on the Cape Verde islands off the coast of modern Senegal before sailing down the coast of Africa, trading goods along the way. Once they had rounded the Bight of Benin, they turned west and followed the equator past the island of Saint Thomas (São Tomé) and toward the Caribbean.

- Rhine. A major river that flows through Germany.

- Rio Grandê. A major estuary in modern Guinea-Bissau.

- Sabrina. A poetic name for the River Severn, which is Britain's longest river and empties into the Bristol Channel.  

- Sanaga. Most likely the Senegal river, which empties into the Atlantic ocean at St. Louis on Senegal's northern border with Mauritania. There is a Sanaga river that empties into the Gulf of Guinea just south of Douala in modern Cameroon, but this appears to have been called the Cameroon or Camarones river prior to the mid-nineteenth century.  

- Scotia. Latin name for Scotland.

- Sheen. The old name for what is now the London borough of Richmond upon Thames.  

- Sparta. A powerful city-state in ancient Greece.

- St. Christopher. The island of St. Christopher or St. Kitts was known as Liamuiga by the indigenous Caribs who lived there. Columbus claimed it on behalf of Spain in 1493, and it was partitioned between the French and the English in the early seventeenth century, at which time it was primarily a tobacco colony. While the two countries exchanged control of the island several times during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was firmly under British control when Grainger left England in 1759 during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). St. Kitts has been part of the nation of St. Kitts and Nevis (also known as the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis) since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1983.  

- St. Croix. An island that now forms part of the US Virgin Islands.

## Plants  

- Acajou \(*Anacardium occidentale*\). Another name for the cashew or cashewnut tree. Its native range is Trinidad to tropical South America. 

- Acassee. Probably the sweet acacia (*Acacia farnesiana*), also known as the West Indian black-thorn. 

- Almond \(*Prunus dulcis*\). A nut primarily native to western Asia. 

- Anana \(*Ananas comosus*\). Pineapple. It originated in Central or South America and was brought by Amerindians to the Caribbean (Higman 188).  

- Anata \(*Bixa orellana*\). Also anatta, anatto, or annatto. A low, shrubby tree native to the tropical Americas that was used from precolonial times by indigenous peoples to produce a reddish-orange dye.  

- Angola's bloomy bush. Refers to the pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*). Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that has historically been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in provision grounds because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 BCE, it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.  

- Avocado. Grainger mentions two kinds of avocado in his note in Book I, p. 8: "the one bearing a green fruit, which is the most delicate, and the other a red, which is less esteemed, and grows chiefly in Mexico." There are multiple varieties of avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as bearing a green fruit may be *Persea americana* var. *americana*, also known as the West Indian avocado. The one that Grainger identifies as growing chiefly in Mexico may be *Persea americana* var. *drymifolia*, also known as the Mexican avocado.  

- Baccacoua. A kind of cassava (*Manihot esculenta*) that Grainger claims only Amerindians consumed (versus Europeans and Africans).    

- Balm. The name of various aromatic plants, particularly those of the genera *Melissa* and *Melittis*.  

- Bay-grape \(*Coccoloba uvifera*\). A seaside plant whose native range is Florida to Peru and the Caribbean to northern South America. 

- Bearded fig \(*Ficus citrifolia*\). Also known as the wild banyan tree or the wild fig, this fig is the national tree of Barbados, and its native range includes Florida and the tropical Americas.  

- Bell-apple. One of several names for *Passiflora laurifolia*, a passion fruit relative whose native range is the Caribbean to northern and northeastern Brazil. 

- Bellyach \(*Jatropha gossypiifolia*\). The bellyache bush has a native range that includes Mexico and the tropical Americas.  

- Bermuda cedar \(*Juniperus bermudiana*\). A species of cedar native to Bermuda that was used by early colonists as building material and fuel. By the 1830s, the ship-building industry had denuded Bermuda of most of its indigenous cedars. It is still a critically endangered species.  

- Bonavist (*Lablab purpureus*). A species of bean whose native range includes the Cape Verde Islands, tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and India.  

- Broom-bush. Gilmore identifies the broom bush as possibly *Sida acuta*, a plant native to Central America with yellow flowers that open in the morning.  

- Cacao \(*Theobroma cacao*\). The cacao tree is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century, when it was branded as a kind of miracle food that would give its consumers health and strength. For instance, see the title of Henry Stubbe's 1662 treatise on chocolate, entitled *The Indian Nectar*, which portrayed chocolate not only as a health food but also as an aphrodisiac. There were also reports from seventeenth-century Jamaica that sailors and others who had to perform hard labor consumed it regularly. It is possible that maroons living in the mountains of Jamaica consumed chocolate as a subsistence food, too (Hughes, *The American Physitian* 131). There are three main varieties of cacao used in commercial chocolate production today: the Forastero, the Trinitario, and the Criollo. The Criollo is the most prized variety. The name "cacao" is derived from the Nahuatl word *cacahuatl*, and the scientific name *Theobroma cacao* also includes a Greek term that translates to "food of the gods."  

- Calaba \(*Calophyllum antillanum*\). A hardwood tree whose native range includes Central America and the Caribbean.  

- Calaloo. Since the seventeenth century, "callaloo" has been used to refer to several different plants. Today, callaloo usually refers to *Amaranthus viridis*, a plant whose native range is the tropical Americas. What the various plants labeled callaloo had in common was the ability of their leaves to serve as edible greens. They are also weedy plants that can survive in a wide range of environments, including wastelands. They formed an important part of the diets of the enslaved, probably because they were a hardy and reliable source of food (Higman 100-107).  

- Candle-weed \(*Senna alata*\). Also known today as the candle bush or king of the forest. Its native range is southwestern Mexico to the tropical Americas.  

- Carnation \(*Caesalpinia pulcherrima*\). Not the modern carnation but instead a shrub that produces showy orange and yellow flowers with red stamens. It was known in the colonial period as *Poinciana pulcherrima*, Barbados Pride, and peacock flower, among other names, most referring to the plant's beauty (the Latin word *pulcher* means beauty). From the seventeenth century, Europeans reported that it was being used by Amerindian and African women in the Americas as an abortifacient: Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), a Dutch naturalist and artist who traveled to Surinam in the seventeenth century, also claimed that women used the plant to induce abortions because they did not want to give birth to children who would be enslaved (2.124-125). The origins of the plant are unclear: some botanists believe it to be native to Asia and an early introduction to the Caribbean, while others believe it to be native to the tropical Americas.  

- Carob tree \(*Ceratonia siliqua*\). Also called the locust bean tree, the carob tree is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey. It is the source of carob, which is often used today as a chocolate substitute.  

- Cassada \(*Manihot esculenta*\). Cassava. Also known as manioc and yuca. It was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. It was one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era; it was subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well. Cultivated varieties of cassava are classed into two groups: bitter and sweet. Bitter cassava is highly poisonous: its roots, which are the parts of the plant that are prepared for consumption, contain cyanide. Cassava has advantages that offset its toxic nature, however: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. The root's poison also can be neutralized by proper processing: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually processed cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads. Sweet cassava is not poisonous and can be eaten without the processing that bitter cassava requires. Although it is more dangerous to eat, bitter cassava historically has been cultivated more than sweet cassava, perhaps because it has a higher yield and because it makes a better flour (Higman 61-69).  

- Cassia. Probably *Cassia fistula*, commonly used as a purgative. It is likely native to India and Sri Lanka.  

- Ceiba \(*Ceiba pentandra*\). Also known as the kapok or silk-cotton tree, the ceiba, whose native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas, can achieve a height of fifty meters. To the Maya, the ceiba was a sacred tree whose roots connected the underworld to the human and upper worlds. 

- Cherimoya \(*Annona cherimola*\). A fruit that originated in South America and is perhaps native to Ecuador.  

- Chickweed \(*Stellaria media*\). A plant native to Europe.  

- Chili-strawberry \(*Fragaria chiloensis*\). Chilean strawberry, native to the Pacific Northwest but probably spread by migratory birds to Hawaii and Chile, where indigenous peoples began cultivating it thousands of years ago. In the eighteenth century, the Chilean strawberry was brought to Europe, where it was crossed with the Virginia strawberry \(*Fragaria virginiana*\) to create today's commercial strawberry \(*Fragaria x ananassa*\).

- China \(*Smilax china*\). The china-root plant is valued for its medicinal properties. Its native range extends from China to Japan and the Philippines.  

- Coco. The coca plant, the source of cocaine. Two species of coca are now in cultivation: *Erythroxylum coca*, whose native range is western South America, and *Erythroxylum novogranatense*, whose native range is Colombia to northwestern Venezuela and Peru.  

- Coco-nut tree \(*Cocos nucifera*\). The coconut palm, which is native to coastal areas of Melanesia and Southeast Asia, has great powers of natural disperal since its nuts (the coconuts) can survive up to 120 days in seawater. Nevertheless, it is believed that Europeans introduced the coconut palm to the Caribbean in the sixteenth century.  

- Coffee. A major agricultural commodity in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

- Cotton. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. 

- Cow-itch \(*Mucuna pruriens*\). Cowitch, a viny plant that produces severe itching after contact with skin; used on sugar plantations as compost, forage, and cattle feed. Its seeds destroy intestinal parasites. Likely native to tropical Asia and possibly Africa.

- Cucumber \(*Cucumis sativus*\). A member of the gourd family, the cucumber has a native range extending from Himalaya to northern Thailand.  

- Custard apple \(*Annona reticulata*\). The fruit of a tree whose native range is Mexico to northeastern Venezuela.

- Dumb Cane \(*Dieffenbachia seguine*\). The dumb cane looks very similar to sugar cane, and colonists often would eat it, mistaking it for the sugar cane. The dumb cane contains a poisonous sap, however, that swells the tongues of those who consume it and prevents them from speaking for several hours. Its native range is the Caribbean and tropical South America.  

- Ebony. Refers to various Asian and African trees of the genus *Diospyros* in the ebony family (Ebenaceae). Historically, ebony wood has been valued for its dark color and used to make furniture, ornaments, and other objects.

- Edda. Edda or eddo commonly referred to taro (*Colocasia esculenta*). It also, however, sometimes referred to as yautia (*Xanthosoma sagittifolium*). Both plants produce roots that were consumed by the enslaved because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. *Colocasia esculenta* originated in southeastern or southern Central Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 CE. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* has a native range extending from Costa Rica to tropical South America (Higman 82-86).  

- English bean \(*Vicia faba*\). Also known as fava, broad, or horse bean. It originated in Western Asia thousands of years ago and spread from there to Central Asia, Europe, and Africa. Beans were sometimes sent from England to the Caribbean to serve as provisions. They also formed part of the provisions of slave ships. The horse bean was not as central to the diets of the enslaved as other bean species, however, many of which were cultivated by the enslaved themselves.

- English field-pea \(*Pisum sativum*\). Also known as the English pea, garden pea, or green pea. Native to Eurasia.

- Fern-tree. Tree ferns are primitive plants that belong to the order Cyatheales. 

- Flower Fence. One of several common names for *Caesalpinia pulcherrima* because it was frequently used as a flowering barrier fence. See entry for "Carnation" above.    

- Forbidden fruit. Refers to species of citrus that are now virtually extinct. It is similar in taste to the orange and the shaddock, and it is closely related to the grapefruit (Higman 180).   

- Ginger \(*Zingiber officinale*\). An herb probably native to India that was brought to the Caribbean by the Spanish in the sixteenth century (Higman 95). 

- Granadilla \(*Passiflora ligularis*\). Passion fruit. Its native range is Panama to Venezuela and Peru.  

- Guaiac. Either *Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean. In the eighteenth century, the guaiac tree also was known as lignum vitae ("wood of life") because it was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. It also was widely believed to be an abortifacient. Both *Guaiacum officinale* and *Guaiacum sanctum* are now endangered due to overexploitation and habitat loss.  

- Guava. A fruit from the small tree *Psidium guajava*, which is probably native to Central and South America but was naturalized throughout the Caribbean by the eighteenth century.  

- Honeysuckle. One of several names for *Passiflora laurifolia*, a passion fruit relative whose native range is the Caribbean to northern and northeastern Brazil. 

- Indian cale. The term "Indian cale" can refer to the species *Colocasia esculenta* and *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*.  

- Indian millet. Another name for Guinea corn \(*Sorghum bicolor*\). Often planted in the provision grounds of the enslaved and a key source of food, as indicated by an eighteenth-century song sung by the enslaved that declares, "Guinea Corn, I long to see you/Guinea Corn, I long to plant you/Guinea Corn, I long to mould you/Guinea Corn, I long to weed you...Guinea Corn, I long to eat you" (qtd. in Higman 231). 

- Indigo (genus *Indigofera*). A major agricultural commodity in the eighteenth-century Caribbean, indigo is found in tropical regions throughout the world. Various species are used in the production of blue dye.

- Ipecacuan. Ipecacuanha, an extract that induces vomiting and that comes from the plant *Carapichea ipecacuanha*, an herbal shrub whose native range is southeastern Nicaragua to Brazil.

- Jalap \(*Mirabilis jalapa*\). Also known as the four o'clock flower because its flowers open in the afternoon. Probably native to Mexico; used by the Aztecs as an ornamental. Sometimes believed to be native to the Peruvian Andes because it was exported from that region to Europe in the 1500s.  

- Knotted grass. Probably *Spigelia anthelmia*, a plant known for its ability to rid the body of intestinal parasites, including tapeworms. Its native range is the tropical and subtropical Americas.

- Lady's-thighs \(*Pyrus communis* 'Jargonelle'\). A pear known today as the jargonelle pear, one of the oldest pears in cultivation.  

- Lemon \(*Citrus limon*\). Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus probably carried lemons to the Caribbean, along with other citrus fruits (Higman 175).  

- Lignum vitae. "Wood of life." The hard, dense wood of the guaiac tree (*Guaiacum officinale* or *Guaiacum sanctum*, both of which have native ranges that include the Caribbean). It was used to treat a variety of diseases, including syphilis and yaws. 

- Lime \(*Citrus aurantifolia*\). Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Columbus brought limes to the Caribbean (Higman 175).  

- Locust bean tree \(*Ceratonia siliqua*\). Also called the carob tree, the locust bean tree is native to Mediterranean Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Turkey. It is the source of carob, which is often used today as a chocolate substitute.  

- Logwood. The commercial product of a tree (*Haematoxylum campechianum*) indigenous to Belize and the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Campeche and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. A source of the dye substance haematoxylin, which produces blue, red, and purple colors.  

- Madre de cacao \(*Gliricidia sepium*\). A tree whose native range includes Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is used as a shade tree for cacao and other plants.  

- Mahoe-berry. May be the berry from the blue mahoe (*Hibiscus elatus*), a tree whose native range is Cuba and Jamaica. Also naturalized to other parts of the Caribbean; now the national tree of Jamaica.  

- Maize \(*Zea mays*\). Also called corn, great corn, and Indian corn. Its native range is Mexico and Guatemala. Maize was introduced to Africa around 1500. Grainger could also be referring to Guinea corn (*Sorghum bicolor*), an important staple crop first cultivated in Africa thousands of years ago (Higman 222-232).

- Mammee apple \(*Mammea americana*\). A large fruit native to the Caribbean and northern South America. 

- Mammee sapota \(*Pouteria sapota*\). A sweet fruit whose native range is Mexico and Central America. Not to be confused with the mammee apple. Another fruit commonly confused with both the mammee sapota and the mammee apple is the nasebery (*Manilkara zapota*), also known as the sapodilla or the nispero. 

- Mangrove. Mangroves are trees of the genus *Rhizophora*, which contains well over a hundred species, most native to the Old World but some native to the New. Mangroves can thrive in soils of varying levels of salinity and have colonized tropical and subtropical coastlines to form forests and thickets.  

- Mezamby. Gilmore identifies mezamby as probably *Cleome gynandra*, a plant whose native range is the tropical and subtropical Old World.  

- Myrtle \(*Myrtus communis*\). An aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region and associated with Venus, the goddess of love.

- Narcissus. The genus *Narcissus* contains several species of plants with yellow flowers, including the daffodil.  

- Niccar \(*Guilandina bonduc*\). The knicker nut is a flowering legume whose native range is the subtropical and tropical parts of the world.  

- Nightshade. Most likely refers to *Atropa belladonna*, a poisonous plant also known as deadly nightshade or belladonna. The foliage, fruits, and roots are all highly toxic, and consuming only ten berries can kill an adult human. Its native range is England to central and southern Europe to Iran.

- Oak \(*Quercus robur*\). The British or English oak, a tree native to Britain. It was long used in shipbuilding, including by the British navy.  

- Ochra \(*Abelmoschus esculentus*\). Okra is probably native to Africa and was one of the most commonly cultivated plants in the provision grounds and gardens of the enslaved. It possesses a glutinous or slimy pulp that was used as a thickener in stews called pepper pots, one of the most popular dishes in the colonial Caribbean (Higman 174-175).  

- Olive \(*Olea europaea*\). The olive tree is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, Africa, and Asia and has been cultivated in the Mediterranean for over five thousand years.  

- Orange. An evergreen citrus tree and fruit. Columbus brought both sour oranges (*Citrus aurantium*) and sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*) to the Caribbean (Higman 175). Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain.  

- Panspan. According to Gilmore, the panspan or hog plum is *Spondias mombin*. Its native range is Mexico to the tropical Americas.  

- Papaw \(*Carica papaya*\). Also pawpaw, better known as the papaya. Its native range is southern Mexico to Venezuela. 

- Pine. Pineapple. See "Anana."

- Plantane. Plantains \(family Musaceae\) are closely related to the banana, and they both formed an important part of the diets of the enslaved (although plantains were more important than bananas). Wild species of plantain and banana originated from and were first cultivated in ancient Southeast Asia, but cultivated species reached Africa in prehistoric times. They were then introduced to Spain by the tenth century and the Canary Islands by the fifteenth. They subsequently were introduced to the Caribbean by the Spanish (Higman 134).  

- Plumb-tree. According to Gilmore, *Spondias purpurea*. Its native range is Mexico to northern Colombia.  

- Prickle-weed. Might refer to *Amaranthus spinosus*, a plant sometimes known as prickly callaloo. Its native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas.  

- Prickly pear. Common name for cactus plants of the genus *Opuntia*, which contains over a hundred species that are distributed throughout the Americas. Also known as nopal and commonly consumed by human beings and animals as food. *Opuntia* was of significant interest to eighteenth-century European naturalists because some species served as food plants for the cochineal insect (*Dactylopius coccus*), the source of a highly prized red dye. 

- Prickly vine. Night-blooming cereus \(*Selenicereus grandiflorus*\), also sometimes known as the queen of the night because of the exquisite beauty and fragrant scent of its large, white flowers. These flowers only open after sunset. Because of this unusual property, the night-blooming cereus became a subject of much speculation and even fantasy on the part of European botanists and observers, who wondered if it could be compared to a nocturnal animal. Botanists today have realized that the flower blooms at night because the cactus' pollinators, which include bats and moths, are nocturnal themselves. They also note the fact that the flower's petals are opalescent and highly visible at night, especially in the moonlight, to attract these pollinators. For more on the night-blooming cereus, see a digital exhibit on "Poetic Botany" created by the New York Botanical Garden (https://www.nybg.org/poetic-botany/selenicereus/). The night-blooming cereus is native to the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, and Nicaragua. 

- Privet. Refers to any of a number of shrubs belonging to the genus *Ligustrum*. Native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia; commonly used for hedging. Some species are invasive.  

- Rhubarb \(*Rheum rhabarbarum*\). A plant whose native range includes southern Siberia and northern and central China. Traditionally used for indigestion and bowel complaints; now commonly used as a fruit.  

- Rice. Rice did not make up a major part of the diets of the enslaved living in the Caribbean islands, but South Carolina was the major Atlantic exporter of the rice species known as *Oryza sativa*, which originated in Asia. There is also a species of rice indigenous to Africa known as *Oryza glaberrima*. Enslaved persons in the Caribbean islands may occasionally have grown both *Oryza sativa* and *Oryza glaberrima* in their provision grounds and gardens.  

- Ricinus. The physic nut plant (*Jatropha curcas*), which is often conflated with the castor oil plant (*Ricinus communis*). The physic nut tree is native to the tropical Americas. It is toxic to human beings and livestock and was often used as a purgative in the eighteenth century.  

- Royal palm \(*Roystonea oleracea*\). A tree that can reach forty meters in height, native to the Lesser Antilles, northern South America, and Guatemala. Grainger also calls it the palmeto.

- Sabbaca. A variety of avocado (*Persea americana*).

- Sand-box tree \(*Hura crepitans*\). A tree that gets its name from its seed pods, which, when dried, were used as sandboxes for blotting ink. Apart from being quite tall, the sandbox tree is peculiar for two other reasons: its leaves, bark, and sap are poisonous, and, when ripe, its seed pods open with loud, explosive sounds, flinging their seeds at speeds exceeding 100 mph. Its native range is the tropical Americas.

- Sappadilla \(*Manilkara zapota*\). The sapodilla, also known as the nasebery or nispero, is a sour or tart fruit whose native range includes Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

- Sarsaparilla. Refers to various species of the genus *Smilax* native to Central and South America. Spanish conquistadors named it *zarzaparilla* and learned from indigenous peoples to use it as an antisyphilitic. Also used to flavor drinks, including root beer in the nineteenth century. 

- Sempre-vive. The genus *Sempervivum* ("always living"), a group of plants native to Europe and parts of Asia.

- Senna. The genus *Senna* contains various plants native to the Old and New World tropics that have laxative effects.  

- Sensitive plant \(*Mimosa pudica*\). The mimosa plant's leaves fold up when touched. It is native to the tropical Americas and became an object of fascination to European naturalists. 

- Shaddoc \(*Citrus maxima*\). The shaddock is a kind of citrus, also known as the pomelo or pummelo. It is native to Southeast Asia and became known as the shaddock in the eighteenth century because it was supposedly brought to the Caribbean by an Englishman named Captain Shaddock.  

- Snakeweed. May be *Euphorbia hyssopifolia*, a plant whose native range is the tropical and subtropical Americas.  

- Solanum \(*Datura stramonium*\). Also known as fireweed or jimsonweed. Probably originated in the tropical regions of Central and South America.  

- Soursop \(*Annona muricata*\). A fruit of tropical American origin.

- Sugar apple \(*Annona squamosa*\). Also known as sweetsop; the fruit of a tree native to lowland Central America.  

- Sugar cane \(*Saccharum officinarum*\). Most likely native to New Guinea, where it was first cultivated thousands of years ago and from where it began to be dispersed by human migrants around 8000 BCE. By the fourth to sixth centuries CE, sugar cane was being refined into crystallized sugar in India and Persia. From there, sugar cane and knowledge of sugar cultivation, processing, and refining traveled to the Mediterranean. The Spanish then transplanted sugar to the Americas and established plantations there. Columbus first brought sugar to the Caribbean in 1493.

- Sweet potato \(*Ipomoea batatas*\). A tuber which probably originated in Central America or northwestern South America.  

- Tamarind \(*Tamarindus indica*\). A tree probably native to tropical Africa and Madagascar. Its fruit pulp was used in food and beverages, including punch, and for medicinal purposes. 

- Tanie. The tanie, tannia, or yautia is technically the species *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*, but it was often confused with taro or eddo (*Colocasia esculenta*). *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* has a native range extending from Costa Rica to tropical South America. *Colocasia esculenta* originated in southeastern or southern Central Asia (Higman 82-86). Tannia and taro leaves were primarily consumed by the enslaved because they contained needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate. These crystals irritated the mouth and throat when eaten, and the leaves had to be boiled for a long period of time to reduce what was known as the "scratching" effect (Higman 86-87).  

- Tea \(*Camellia sinensis*\). The species from which commercially produced tea is derived. Its native range is Southeastern Asia. Tea and coffee, as well as chocolate, were introduced to Europe as exotic beverages in the seventeenth century.

- Thyme. Plants of the genus *Thymus*, native to Greenland, Eurasia, and northeastern tropical Africa.  

- Tobacco \(*Nicotiana tabacum*\). A major agricultural commodity in the eighteenth-century Caribbean and native to the Americas. It was introduced from the Americas to Africa in the 1500s.

- Water-melon \(*Citrullus lanatus*\). The watermelon is native to Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Sudan.  

- White cedar. The white cedar is probably *Tabebuia heterophylla*, a timber tree widely distributed throughout the Caribbean.  

- Wild liquorice \(*Abrus precatorius*\). A slender, viny plant that produces scarlet, pea-sized seeds with small black spots at the points of attachment. The seeds are known as jumbee beads, while the plant is sometimes known as the rosary pea. The seeds are commonly used to make jewelry, and they have been associated with the practice of obeah, perhaps because the black spots on the seeds resemble eyes. The seeds also may have been used to heal or poison since they contain the toxin abrin, which can induce nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and dehydration. *Abrus precatorius* is native to Africa, Asia, Malesia, Australia, and the Pacific region.  

- Wild pine-apple \(*Bromelia pinguin*\). Its native range is Mexico and the tropical Americas. 

- Wild red cedar \(*Cedrela odorata*\). The red cedar is an important timber tree found in Central and South America, as well as in the Caribbean. It is now considered vulnerable to extinction due to unsustainable levels of harvesting.  

- Worm-grass. Gilmore suggests that this is knotted grass (*Spigelia anthelmia*).  

- Yam. One of the most important food crops for enslaved persons in the Caribbean. There are several reasons yams (genus *Discorea*) became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as crucially, yams formed a part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. Although there is one South American species of yam (*Dioscorea trifida*) that was transplanted to the Caribbean by Amerindians and consumed by subsequent inhabitants of the region, more widely used species in the colonial period included *Dioscorea cayenensis*, which is native to West Africa, and *Dioscorea alata*, which is native to Southeast Asia but had been introduced to the west coast of Africa by the Portuguese and Spanish by the sixteenth century (Higman 72-81). Roasting and boiling are two of the easiest ways to prepare yams and were thus two methods commonly employed by the enslaved. In the eighteenth-century Caribbean, enslaved persons also regularly prepared yams by following the long-established West African practice of pounding them with a mortar and pestle until they formed a paste that could be rolled into small balls. Pounded yams were sometimes known as *fufu*, a term derived from the Twi and Ga-Adangme languages that also applied to pounded plantain and cassava (Higman 78-81).  

- Yellow thistle. Most likely *Argemone mexicana*, the seeds of which are purgative. Also known as the Mexican prickly poppy; native to the tropical Americas.
