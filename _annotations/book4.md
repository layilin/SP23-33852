125.6 Papaw. Papaya; <!--copy note-->  
125.9 Rio Grandê. Major estuary in modern day Guinea-Bissau.  
125.9 Sanaga. Likely the Senegal river, which empties into the Atlantic ocean at St. Louis on Senegal's northern border with Mauritania. <!--thought this was the Senegal river (as does Gilmore), but there is a modern Sanaga river just south of Douala in Cameroon; have not found it on an 18thC map -->

126.23 bays. Laurel (bay leaf) crown, often associated with poetic achievement. <!--also military victory-->  
126.24 Sylvan bard <!--check-->  
126.25 Melvil. Robert Melville (1723-1809), Scottish army officer and colonial governor. Like Grainger, he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh before joining the British army and fighting in the War of Austrian Succession. During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), he faught in the Caribbean, becoming temporary governor of Guadeloupe after defeating the French, and being named governor of Grenada, the Grenadines, Tobago, Dominica, and St. Vincent in 1764.  
126.28 indian wreath <!--check-->  
126.31 myrtle <!--copy-->  

127.35 jetty. Jet black.  
127.42 sunny Libyan. North African. <!--check-->  
127.44 Congo's wide-extended plains. Kingdom in southwest African north of Angola and near the modern Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  
127.45 long Zaire. Zaire or Congo river. The second longest river in Africa, it drains into the Atlantic Ocean on the coast of the DRC.
127.51 mechanic art. Here Grainger recommends that enslaved persons from the Congo be assigned specific trades rather than be forced to work as field laborers.  
127.52 ductile. Malleable; flexible.

128.62 Golden Coast. One of the four major trading region defined by European nations on the coast of West Africa.  These included the Grain Coast (modern day Sierra Leone and Liberia), the Ivory Coast (modern Cote d'Ivoire), the Gold Coast (modern Ghana), and the Slave Coast (modern Togo, Benin, and Nigeria). These modern designations are approximations of eighteenth-century geographical regions. Certainly, people were enslaved from a much of the West African coast ranging at least from Senegal to Angola. <!-- Although I wrote it, this note makes me uncomfortable for all kinds of reasons CS -->  
128.63 Papaws. Also Popo. West African in the region between Accra in modern day Ghana and Ouidah in Benin. <!--see Gilmore too-->
128.65 Volta. Volta river in Ghana, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Accra (in modern Ghana).  
128.65 Rey. Likely the Rey (or Rio del Rey) estuary in modern day Cameroon. It is not clear whether Grainger means a specific river within this system.  
128.71 oft by suicide. At every stage of the slave trade -- from kidnapping and embarkation in Africa to transportation across the Atlantic, sale, and forced labor in the Americas -- suicide was one of the greatest concerns expressed by enslavers from the seventeenth century through abolition in the nineteenth century.  
128.72 gang. The enslaved on any plantation -- especially field laborers.  
128.82 Cormantee. Name given to Fanti people from Kormantse in the modern nation of Ghana. By the mid eighteenth century, the name Cormantee was associated with warlike people who resisted enslavement and who often led rebellions in the colonies. <!--get sources right-->  
128.88 poinard. Dagger.  
128.91 clayey tubes. Pipes.  
128.94 rice, or yams, or lofty maize. Three major food crops in West Africa. While rice and yams were indigenous to the region, maize is a New World crop that was brought to Africa. <!--confirm; do we need scientific names here?-->  

130.99 Minnah. City in central modern Nigeria. <!--have not found Minna on historical 18thC maps yet--> OR; Elmina, a city on modern Ghana's Atlantic coast. It was the first European settlement in West Africa, and a major stop in the Atlantic slave trade.  
130.102 Moco-nation. People from the region between Bonny Island and Calabar on the southeast coast of modern Nigeria <!-- https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/s/794d7o and near bonny here: https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/s/41t1wo and here: https://jcb.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/s/r654yp-->  
130.103 worms.  Parasite <!--complicated note because there are all kinds of possible worms. Prob tapeworm; see Gilmore-->  
130.104 Mundingo. Mandinka people of central West Africa around modern Senegal, Guinea, Mali, and Cote D'Ivoire. The Mandingo were predominantly Muslim and largely literate. <!--check precision-->  
130.106 learned leach. Physician.  
130.108 Phoebus. The sun.  
130.110 Elysium. Part of the Greek underworld reserved for heroes.  
130.113 Quanza. Cuanzo river in modern Angola. It drains into the Atlantic Ocean south of Luanda (known in the eighteenth century as Loango or Loando). This line therefore refers to enslaved people from Angola, who were primarily victims of the Portuguese trade.  
130.114 prone to bloat <!--not sure about this one-->  
130.119 Ethiop. Generic term for African, rather a person from Ethiopia.  
130.121 Machaon. Greek physician and son of Asclepius (son of Apollo and god of medicine).  
130.123 vervain. Plant from the *Verbena* family, widely used in medicine from at least the time of the ancient Egyptians.  
130.123 sempre-vive. *Sempervivum* ("always living"). Plant widely used in medicine, described here by Grainger as a laxative <!--see Gilmore for these 2 notes-->.  
130.127 white eagle. Calomel, or mercuric chloride. Medicine widely used in the eighteenth century for its laxative and purgative effects, also described here by Grainger as a vermifuge.  
130.133 The novel gang. Enslaved Africans newly arrived in the Caribbean.  Here Grainger is describing a practice known as "seasoning".
130.136 acajou. Cashew tree (*Anacardium occidentale*) native to Brazil. As Grainger and others note, the fruit of the cashew tree is caustic and is said to have been used by women as a chemical peel to remove freckles. See for example Maria Riddell, *Voyages to the Madeira, and Leeward Isles* (Edinburgh, 1792), 82-83.  

132.141 rheums. Mucous secretions from the eyes, nose, and mouth. Comparable perhaps to a head cold, but often thought by eighteenth-century physicians to lead to further (and more serious) illness.  
132.141 dysenteric. Having to do with dysentery, or diarrhea.  
132.142 hydrops. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body, more commonly known as dropsy.  The modern term is edema (or oedema). <!--Gilmore has diabetes, which might make more sense in context-->  
132.144 Lybians. Here used as a generic term for Africans.  
132n Gum-Arabic. Edible sap from the Acacia tree used as a glue/binder in foods and medicines.  
132.150 swallow dirt. Physicians and enslavers were fascinated with geophagy, or dirt eating among enslaved Africans (also called pica). They variously thought it was the symptom of a physical or psychological ailment that would invariably lead to death.  
132.150 Chlorotic fair. Chlorosis (also called green sickness) was thought to be an illness that afflicted young women. It could be accompanied by a greenish hue and produce a desire to eat dirt.  

133.151 poignant cates. Food. Here Grainger uses it in the sense of "delicacies".  
133.152 dropsy. An accumulation of fluid in the soft tissue of the body.  The modern term is Edema (or oedema).  
133.156 Paean. Apollo.  
133.160 provender. Food for cattle.  Especially hay and dried grains.  
133.162 made her annual progress. Referring to the seasoning process for enslaved persons newly arrived from Africa, Grainger recommends avoiding field labor for a year.  
133.163 conch. Family of marine molluscs best know for their large shells, which can be used as musical horns when properly blown.  
133.165 Nor, Negroe. This and the following 40 lines are the only in the poem where the narrator addresses the enslaved directly.  
133.169 dark tartarean caves. Having to do with Tartarus, the part of the Greek underworld reserved for the wicked. Here Grainger refers to the work of miners.  

134.173 And in dread ruin all its inmates whelm?. Improved technology in the seventeenth century facilitated the construction of deeper coal mines in Scotland, where coal was a major domestic export in the eighteenth century. The rising demand for coal quickly exhausted accessible deposits, necessitating deeper mines that extended hundreds of feet into the earth. Unsupported rocks and flooding during heavy rains led to fatal collapses within the underground shafts and tunnels, and poor ventilation meant that flammable gases such as carbon monoxide and methane could ignite the combustible coal dust in the air, causing devastating dust explosions.  

134.175 exhalations of the deep-dug mine. When steam-driven pumps and winders became available in the mining industry, lead was mined in long seams in the fashion of trenches; during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the steam engine's ability to pump water through underground channels to wind the ore to the surface allowed for mines to be dug deeper. See also note for [internal] Book IV, line 173.  

134.178 Scotia. Scotia, a name for Scotland. Southwestern Scotland had produced lead since the Roman period. The Scottish Habeas Corpus Act of 1701 did not apply to those in servitude in the coal and lead mines of Scotland, who could be bound in serf-like bondage to employers by ancient custom. Such workers could be sold or leased with the undertaking of mining work and were accounted as a part of the inventory. Vagabonds and their families could be seized and returned to work. It was not until 1774 that an Emancipation Act forbade mine owners from accepting new servitudes and provided for the emancipation of existing workers who had served for a certain number of years. Only in 1799 were all miners legally freed.  

134.180 palsies. Palsy, paralysis of the skeletal muscles.  

134.181 Who, on the margin of the the rocky Drave. As Grainger's footnote to this line explains, the Drave, or Drava, is a river in central Europe. It forms the boundary between Croatia and Hungary. Silver was a major mineral output for central European regions in Germany, Hungary, and Tyrol, particularly in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, until the discovery of gold and silver mines in South America shifted western European attentions further abroad.  

134.187 See them dragg'd in chains. With the chained people, Grainger adverts to Spanish colonial oppression and exploitation of native populations in South America. The Incan empire, alluded to in line 185, extended from modern Ecuador to Chile in the early sixteenth century when Spanish conquistadors arrived and imposed colonial rule. In particular, the silver mines at Potosí in Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia) drove Spanish settlement, and native populations were subjected to the *encomienda* system, in which an *encomendero* accepted tribute and obligatory labor from natives in return for protection. In the early seventeenth century this gave way to a *corregimiento* system that established networks of provincial governors who managed the labor distribution and tributary arrangements. African slaves were also imported and put to work in mines when labor ran short, gradually surpassing the natives in population size. Besides silver, gold deposits were found throughout the Andes, from Venezuela to Chile, and European settlers expanded the extant mining work of the native Americans in both scale and productivity.  

135.207 humours. In classical and medieval medicine, humours denoted four bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, choler, melancholy or black bile) that were believed to determine an individual's state of health and temperament according to their proportions in the body. The term also came to be used more generally to refer to various other bodily fluids and the balance thereof, whether normal or abnormal.  

136.215 Indus. Indus, a river in southern Asia, rising in the Kailas mountain range in Tibet and flowing through India and Pakistan.  

136.229 these uninstructed swains. See note for [internal] Book I, line 9.  

137.246 worm. Guinea worm, or the dragon worm (*Dracunculus medinensis*), is a parasitic nematode acquired by drinking water contaminated by the water flea *Cyclops*, which carries the worm's larvae. The larvae break through the stomach lining and enter the bloodstream, growing to full size within a year. A pregnant female worm lives in connective tissues beneath the skin and eventually will release its larvae into a large blister, usually on the legs or arms. The worm's migration produces symptoms such as itching, giddiness, breathing difficulties, vomiting, and diarrhea. The worm may come out spontaneously with the released larvae, but typically treatment involved attaching the worm to the end of a stick and winding it slowly out of the opening in the skin over the course of several days—this is the "leaden cylinder" that Grainger mentions in line 252. A broken worm causes an extreme allergic reaction that can be fatal, and blisters on the skin may ulcerate and become infected, resulting in an abscess and the "annual lameness" of which Grainger warns in line 255. Today the worm may also be treated through anthelmintics.  

137.255 Moor. Moor, a name for a native or inhabitant of Mauretania in North Africa, which corresponds to present-day Morocco and Algeria. The name also came to be applied to Muslim people of mixed Berber and Arab descent in North Africa.  

138.256 dragon worm. Also known as the guinea worm or the medina worm (*Dracunculus medinensis*), it is a parasitic worm of the phylum Nematoda that lives in tropical regions of Asia, Africa, South America, and the West Indies and causes the disease known as guinea worm disease. 

138.264 AEthiop-kind. A term used to denote a black or dark-skinned person, a black African, and/or occasionally someone from Ethiopia. 

138.268n farinaceous. Consisting or made of flour or meal, starchy.

139.271 ichor. In Greek mythology, the ethereal fluid believed to have flowed through the veins of the gods. 

139.282 defoedations. The action of contaminating, polluting, or infecting something, especially the blood or skin. 

[plant] 139.283 guaiac pods. Fruit of the guaiac or lignum vitae tree (*Guaiacum officinale*), used to treat respiratory and venereal diseases.

140.291 Proteus-like. In Greek mythology, Proteus, an old man and shepherd on the island of Pharos near Egypt, was able to shape-shift. The worms' ability to cause multiple maladies and symptoms is equated to Proteus's shape-shifting abilities.

140.296 Mania. Roman and Etruscan goddess of the dead who ruled the underworld with Mantus.

140.300 Ague. An acute or high fever, or a disease that causes such. Often used to refer to malaria. 

141.312 vermifuge. A medicine that caused or promoted the evacuation or expulsion of worms and other parasites from the body. 

[place] 141.317 Cornish mine. Places of rich mineral deposit in Cornwall and the surrounding areas in western Britain.

[people] 141.319 Tyrians. Inhabitants of Tyre, town on the Mediterranean coast in southern Lebanon. It was a major Phoenician seaport for trade between 2000 BCE through the Roman period. 

[place] 141.323 Attic's sterile land. Attica, the ancient distrct of east-central Greece, its chief city being Athens. Maritime trade far surpassed its agriculture.   

[people] 141.317n Strabo. Strabo (64 BCE - 21 CE), Greek geographer and historian whose work *Geography* outlined the countries and peoples of the Greco-Roman world under the reign of Augustus (27 BCE - 14 CE).

[place] 142.330 Enna. City and province in central Sicily, headquarters of a Sicilian slave revolt (134-132 BCE).

[place] 142.330 Belgian fens. Refers to the High Fens, a highland plateau in the eastern Belgian province of Liege. 

142.345 Sylvanus. Commonly spelled Silvanus, the Roman god of the countryside that is often associated with woodlands and agriculture.

142.346 Ceres. The Italo-Roman goddess of food growth, often worshipped in conjunction with the Earth goddess Tellus.

[place] 143.353. white Albion. Derived from the Latin word for white, Albion refers to Great Britain, potentially referencing the white cliffs of Dover.

[place] 143.356. main. Refers to the Caribbean and mainland American colonies.

143.359 Eurus. In Greek mythology, the East Wind.

[people] 143.360. Columbus. Christopher Columbus (1450/1451-1506). Sailed to the Caribbean islands on a voyage thought to be a route to Asia sponsored by King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile. Columbus made three such voyages, establishing a colony at Hispaniola where he served as governor before he was briefly imprisoned for violent and incompetent governance.

[place] 143.363. Lusitania's. A Roman province named for its inhabitants, the Lusitani. Modern-day Portugal.

143.369. bewitch'd. A reference to obeah, a set of Afro-Caribbean medicinal and religious practices. Colonial descriptions of obeah vary from magic to superstition to folk medicine. (general outline drawn from *Atlantic Studies* vol. 12 no. 2 "Obeah: knowledge, power, and writing in the early Atlantic World"). Colonial writers describe enslaved persons using plants or herbs to heal sickness or bring the dead back to life as well as deploying charms to defend against bullets or death, among other uses. Most accounts register the rebellious nature of these practices, and Grainger's poem was published in the aftermath of a large, coordinated 1760 rebellion in Jamaica that involved approximately 1,500 enslaved persons in which obeah played a particularly important role. (see Vincent Brown's http://revolt.axismaps.com/project.html) <!--how much would we like to include in a footnote if we are also writing an essay about obeah? Can definitely cite specific examples (Long, Sloane, Singleton, Moseley, etc.)-->

[place] 144.370n. Guinea. Now the Republic of Guinea. Its name is derived from the Portuguese "akal n-iguinamen," or "land of the black men."

146.415n. Linnaeus...Dr. Stork. Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), was a Swedish naturalist who established a new taxonomic system and was particularly renowned for his botanic knowledge. Author of *Species Plantarum*, *Genera Plantarum*, and *Systema Naturae*. <!--can't find Dr. Stork-->

[people] 147.424 Ethiop. Ethiop and Ethiopia (also Aethiop and Aethiopia) were sometimes used by the Greeks and Romans to refer to a specific people and region of Africa, but Ethiop was used to designate a generically black African as well. Ethiopians also were referenced in a classical proverb about "washing the Ethiopian" or turning black skin white. The proverb and subsequent versions, which were widely circulated in the early modern period and eighteenth century, framed the task as impossible and hence were used in justifications of racial difference and African inferiority based on skin color.  

147.430 Deny subsistence to their labouring slaves. Grainger addresses the fact that planters regularly provided plantation laborers with insufficient provisions to economize on costs. At the same time, planters did not engage in the large-scale cultivation of provision crops on Caribbean lands because they wanted to dedicate all fertile land to sugar. As a result, although they were required to work full-time producing sugar and other commodity crops, enslaved laborers frequently were required to tend provision gardens or plots of land upon which they cultivated food crops to supplement the provisions provided by planters. The lands allotted for provision grounds were generally rocky, mountainous plots with poor soil. 

[plant] 147.434 English beans, or Carolinian rice. Beans or peas, as they were often called in the Caribbean, were a major source of nutrition for the enslaved. English beans are also known as fava, broad, or horse beans (*Vicia faba*), which originated in Western Asia thousands of years ago and spread from there to Central Asia, Europe, and Africa. They were sometimes sent from England to the Caribbean to serve as provisions. They also formed part of the provisions of slave ships. The horse bean was not as central to the diets of the enslaved as other bean species, however, many of which were cultivated by the enslaved themselves. Rice also did not make up a major part of the diets of the enslaved, but South Carolina was the major Atlantic exporter of the rice species known as *Oryza sativa*, which originated in Asia. There is also a species of rice indigenous to Africa known as *Oryza glaberrima*. Enslaved Africans occasionally may have grown both *Oryza sativa* and *Oryza glaberrima* in their provision grounds and gardens, but it never was a major source of subsistence.  

147.435 Iërne's beef, or Pensilvanian flour;. Iërne is a term for Ireland, which supplied Caribbean plantations with salted beef and other provisions. Beef also came from the North American colonies, as did flour. 

147.436 Newfoundland cod, or herrings from the main. The waters off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic constituted one of the major fisheries of the world for the Atlantic cod (*Gadus morhua*) in the eighteenth century. Planters imported cod for enslaved laborers, who needed protein to function, but they imported what came to be known as "West India cod," which was salted cod of the poorest quality.  

148.448 This let them cultivate, one day, each week. Enslaved laborers generally were required to go to their provision grounds one day per week to tend them. In certain colonies, however, an internal marketing system gradually emerged that may have encouraged some to spend extra time cultivating their provision grounds. For instance, in Jamaica, those who participated in the system were able to sell or trade their provisions for other goods and currency. They were also able to supplement the inadequate diet provided to them by planters, although those individuals who cultivated provision grounds did not enjoy, on average, better health or longer lifespans than those dependent primarily on imported rations. Still, the provision grounds did offer their cultivators some control over what they ate, as they were responsible for choosing what plants to cultivate, and, in limited cases, they also offered some degree of economic autonomy. They also laid the foundation for the peasant economies that emerged in the British Caribbean in the post-emancipation era.  

[plant] 148.449 And there raise yams, and there cassada's root. Yams, one of many species of tuber within the *Dioscorea* genus, were widely cultivated in provision grounds, in part because they did not require regular care to thrive. There are several other reasons yams became important to Afro-Caribbean diets: yam crop yields are high, yams are easily stored, and they can be prepared in several different ways. Just as importantly, yams formed an important part of West African diets long before the commencement of the slave trade. As a result, slave traders often shipped large quantities of yams on trans-Atlantic voyages to feed the people on board, and yams accompanied Africans to the Americas, where they were able to continue cultivating them. Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), also known as manioc, yuca, and bitter cassava, was domesticated in South America thousands of years ago and then brought to the Caribbean islands by Amerindians. It was one of the most important food sources for Amerindians during the precolonial era and subsequently adopted by Africans and Europeans in the Caribbean as well, although it was not as important a food source as the yam. Nevertheless, it still appeared in provision grounds because it is an easy crop to cultivate: it can grow in poor soils and conditions, one planting produces several harvests, and the roots can be stored in the ground for a long time without spoiling. These advantages offset cassava's toxic nature: its roots, which are the parts of the plant prepared for consumption, contain cyanide, and the raw roots are poisonous to human beings. The poison can be neutralized by proper processing, however: Amerindians and other early Caribbean consumers usually prepared cassava root by grating it and then pressing the poisonous juice out of it to make a flour, which could be eaten as a porridge or turned into various cakes or breads.  

[plant] 148.454-455 There let angola's bloomy bush supply, For many a year, with wholesome pulse their board. Refers to the pigeon pea (*Cajanus cajan*). Pigeon pea is a drought-resistant crop that historically has been important for small-scale farmers in semi-arid areas. It was commonly grown in the provision grounds or gardens of enslaved Africans because it could survive without much water or attention. It is native to South Asia and was first domesticated in India. By 2000 B.C.E., it also was being cultivated in East Africa, from where it was brought to the Americas, most likely as a result of the slave trade.  

[plant] 148.456 bonavist. A species of bean (*Lablab purpureus*) native to Cape Verde, tropical and southern Africa, Madagascar, and India.  

[people] 148.449n Ogilvy's America. John Ogilby's *America: Being an accurate description of the New World* (1670).  

[plant] 149.457-458 ochra...slimy pulp...help disdains. Okra (*Abelmoschus esculentus*) is native to tropical Africa and was one of the most commonly cultivated plants in the provision grounds and gardens of the enslaved. It possesses a glutinous or slimy pulp that was used as a thickener in stews called pepper pots, one of the most popular dishes in the colonial Caribbean.  

[plant] 149.459-460 potatos...Sweet as the cane-juice is the root they bear. Grainger refers to sweet potatoes (*Ipomoea batatas*), not to be confused with potatoes (*Solanum tuberosum*) or yams (genus *Dioscorea*). The sweet potato is native to Central America or northwestern South America but had spread to the Caribbean islands by the time of Columbus' first voyage. It was an important food crop for Amerindians.  

[plant] 149.461 eddas. *Colocasia esculenta* or *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. The name edda or eddo commonly refers to *Colocasia esculenta*. *Colocasia esculenta* and *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* were often conflated, however. Both plants produce roots that were commonly consumed by enslaved Africans because they were easy to cultivate and had a high yield. In addition to being called edda or eddo, *Colocasia esculenta* also went by the common names dasheen or taro. It is native to Asia but was being cultivated in Africa by 100 C. E. From there, it was brought to the Americas on slave ships, which stocked it as food. *Xanthosoma sagittifolium* also went by the common name yautia and is native to Central and South America.  

[plant] 149.462 Indian cale, and foodful calaloo. The term "Indian cale" also can refer to the species *Colocasia esculenta* and *Xanthosoma sagittifolium*. Since the seventeenth century, "callaloo" has been used to refer to several different plants. Today, callaloo usually refers to *Amaranthus viridis*, a plant native to the tropical Americas. What the various plants labeled callaloo had in common was the ability of their leaves to serve as edible greens. They are also weedy plants that can survive in a wide range of environments, including wastelands. They formed an important part of the diets of enslaved Africans, probably because they are a hardy and reliable source of food.  

[plant] 149.463 mint. Plants of the genus *Mentha*, distributed around the world.  

[plant] 149.463 thyme. Plants of the genus *Thymus*, native to Greenland, Eurasia, and northeast tropical Africa.   

[plant] 149.463 balm. The name of various aromatic plants, particularly those of the genera *Melissa* and *Melittis*.  

[plant] 149.457n they differ from potatos at home, they probably are not European...four kinds, the red, the white, the long, and round. The sweet potato is native to Central America or northwestern South America but had spread to the Caribbean islands by the time of Columbus' first voyage. There are numerous varieties of sweet potato, which differ from each other in appearance and taste. 

149.457n The juice of each may be made into a pleasant cool drink; and, being distilled, yield an excellent spirit. Mobby or mobbie, an alcoholic drink made from the sweet potato. The origin of the drink's name is Carib.  

[plant] 149.462n mezamby. Unidentified.  

[plant] 149.462n Jamaica prickle-weed. Might refer to *Amaranthus spinosus*, a plant native to the tropical Americas that is sometimes known as prickly callaloo. 

149.462n esculent. Suitable for food, edible.  

[plant] 150.465 limes. *Citrus aurantifolia*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the lime.  

[plant] 150.466 bushy citrons. *Citrus medica*. Citrus fruits originated in Southeast Asia and spread from there to the Mediterranean and Spain. Christopher Columbus brought several citrus fruits to the Caribbean, including the citron.  

[plant] 150.469 cotton shrub. Commercial cotton (genus *Gossypium*) is produced from several different species, some of which are native to the Old World and others of which are native to the New World. 

[plant] 150.471 coffee. Coffee is made from the roasted seeds of the genus *Coffea*. *Coffea arabica*, the most widely cultivated species, is native to northeast tropical Africa.

[plant] 150.474 cocô. Another term for cacao. The cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*) is the source of chocolate, which is made from the seeds of the cacao tree. Cacao is native to Central and South America and was first cultivated by Amerindians thousands of years ago. Europeans first encountered cacao in Mexico, where the Aztecs placed a high value on it: cacao was prepared into chocolate drinks that were consumed by the Aztec elite, as well as during religious rituals, and cacao seeds were used as currency and tribute. Cacao was first brought to the Caribbean by Spaniards, who established plantations to supply Europe with chocolate. Although some Europeans initially found the taste of chocolate off-putting (the Aztecs did not add sugar to their chocolate), it was being consumed in Europe in significant quantities by the seventeenth century.  

150.474 thy rich pods. Cacao trees produce large pods that contain the cacao seeds, also known as cacao beans or nuts.
